This is tool based on Interception library (https://github.com/oblitum/Interception). It maps left control to left alt, left alt to caps lock, and maps cursor movement to RightAlt + OP[]KL:;' - takes time to get used to but greatly reduces needs for quirky hand movements and enables me to use TKL small keyboards.
Code is very much draft.
